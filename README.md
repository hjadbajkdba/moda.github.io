# MoDA: Multi-modal Diffusion Architecture for Talking Head Generation

## Overview

MoDA (Multi-modal Diffusion Architecture) addresses the challenges of talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio in virtual environments. Current methods struggle with synthesizing diverse facial expressions and natural head movements while ensuring synchronized lip movements with the audio. MoDA introduces innovative technologies to overcome these issues, resulting in enhanced video diversity, realism, and efficiency.

## Abstract

Talking head generation has become a crucial problem in the virtual metaverse. Despite significant progress, current methods still struggle to generate natural head movements, diverse facial expressions, and synchronized lip movements with speech audio. The primary challenge lies in stylistic discrepancies between speech audio, individual identity, and portrait dynamics. MoDA tackles these issues with a multi-modal diffusion architecture that models interactions between motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions. A coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to integrate different conditions progressively, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

## Key Features
- **Motion, Audio, and Identity Interaction Modeling**: MoDA explicitly models the interactions between motion, audio, and identity features, enhancing facial expressions and head movements.
- **Coarse-to-Fine Fusion**: MoDA employs a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy for progressively integrating different conditions.
- **Improved Realism and Efficiency**: MoDA enhances video diversity and realism, making it suitable for real-world applications.
